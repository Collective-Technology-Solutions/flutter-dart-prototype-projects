# flutter-dart-prototype-projects
Flutter and Dart Prototype Projects, each prototype in its own directory.

## Goals
- capture fairly-focused technology examples in Dart and/or Dart with Flutter
- provide a public-facing eample code set for Dart and Flutter projects

## Restrictions
- No propriatry code should be placed in this repo. 

## Requirements
- The only file to sit at the top level will be this README.md.
- Each project is in it's own named project directory.
   - Projects with only Dart prototype project code should start with "dart-" and then the name of the project.
   - Simularily, projects with Flutter prototype project code should start with "flutter-" and then the name of the project.
- Each project must have a README.md which specifies the prototype projects goals and technologies on display. Any special setup conditions must be specified if required to clone and build isn't enough.  
- Each project should be isolated from other projects by default.

## Suggestions
- use Android Studio or IntelliJ
- use Visual Code
- when possible, isolate IDE project files from project code
